Welcome to Decent Labs.  

![Research Reverse Release; Repeat](https://github.com/decentlabs-north/whiteboard/raw/master/iterate.svg)

I am relaying a message from the **North** octant,  
because I used to be the only one in it until I realized I was not.

We are a decentralized organization.   
Meaning; _nobody really knows who's in it or who gets paid when for what._

To join, just say:
```
Network without super node
```
three times out loud into empty space and you are in.

The main objective is to spawn humble hacks for the planet,  
and broadcast good vibes. 

_Wake up_; do decent stuff, that's it.
